# SchoolGradingSystem
This is a java project where you are able to input the name and unique id of a student including their given grade and then it would print out the names based on the grading. This project is a practice project to sharpen my skills, I struggle to understand the concept of enhanced for loops and creating a list of objects of a custom class so this project is helping me understand those concepts.

## Terminal Commands
1. To be able to run the program you must make sure you open the directory of the SchoolGradeSystem folder

```
cd "SchoolGradeSystem"
```
2. After that you would want to go to the source code:
```
cd src
```
3. Once then run the main class.
```
Java -cp src main.java
```




## Instructions

1. Start by running the main class in your IDE of choice or running it from the terminal using the commands above
